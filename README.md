## Fork 后的变更
* 支持 Java8 [![](https://jitpack.io/v/cn-src/easy-batch.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#cn-src/easy-batch)


## Project status

As of November 18, 2020, Easy Batch is in maintenance mode. This means only bug fixes will be addressed from now on.
Version 7.0.x is the only supported version.

## Latest news

* 24/09/2020: Version 7.0.0 is out with several enhancements towards type safe APIs. See the change log [here](https://github.com/j-easy/easy-batch/releases).

# What is Easy Batch?

Easy Batch is a framework that aims to simplify batch processing with Java. It was **specifically** designed for simple ETL jobs.
Writing batch applications requires a **lot** of boilerplate code: reading, writing, filtering, parsing and validating data, logging, reporting to name a few..
The idea is to free you from these tedious tasks and let you focus on your batch application's logic.

# How does it work?

Easy Batch jobs are simple processing pipelines. Records are read in sequence from a data source, processed in pipeline and written in batches to a data sink:

![batch processing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/j-easy/easy-batch/images/batch-processing.png)

The framework provides the `Record` and `Batch` APIs to abstract data format and process records in a consistent way regardless of the data source type.

Let's see a quick example. Suppose you have the following `tweets.csv` file:

```
id,user,message
1,foo,hello
2,bar,@foo hi!
```

and you want to transform these tweets to XML format. Here is how you can do that with Easy Batch:

```java
Path inputFile = Paths.get("tweets.csv");
Path outputFile = Paths.get("tweets.xml");
Job job = new JobBuilder<String, String>()
         .reader(new FlatFileRecordReader(inputFile))
         .filter(new HeaderRecordFilter<>())
         .mapper(new DelimitedRecordMapper<>(Tweet.class, "id", "user", "message"))
         .marshaller(new XmlRecordMarshaller<>(Tweet.class))
         .writer(new FileRecordWriter(outputFile))
         .batchSize(10)
         .build();

JobExecutor jobExecutor = new JobExecutor();
JobReport report = jobExecutor.execute(job);
jobExecutor.shutdown();
```

This example creates a job that:

* reads records one by one from the input file `tweets.csv`
* filters the header record
* maps each record to an instance of the `Tweet` bean
* marshals the tweet to XML format
* and finally writes XML records in batches of 10 to the output file `tweets.xml`

At the end of execution, you get a report with statistics and metrics about the job run (Execution time, number of errors, etc).
All the boilerplate code of resources I/O, iterating through the data source, filtering and parsing records, mapping data to the domain object `Tweet`, writing output and reporting
is handled by Easy Batch. Your code becomes declarative, intuitive, easy to read, understand, test and maintain.
 
 ## Quick start
 
Add the following dependency to your project and you are ready to go:
 
 ```xml
 <dependency>
     <groupId>org.jeasy</groupId>
     <artifactId>easy-batch-core</artifactId>
     <version>7.0.0</version>
 </dependency>
```

You can also generate a quick start project with the following command:

```
$>mvn archetype:generate \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jeasy \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=easy-batch-archetype \
      -DarchetypeVersion=7.0.0
```
